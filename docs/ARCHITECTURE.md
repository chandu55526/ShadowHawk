# ShadowHawk Architecture

## System Overview

ShadowHawk is built with a microservices architecture, focusing on scalability and maintainability.

### Core Components

1. **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
   - Dashboard for threat visualization
   - Real-time monitoring interface
   - User authentication and management
   - Responsive design for all devices

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Real-time threat detection engine
   - Database management
   - Authentication and authorization

3. **Browser Extension**
   - Real-time URL scanning
   - Threat detection at the browser level
   - Seamless integration with the dashboard

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Redux for state management
- Socket.io for real-time updates
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript for type safety
- MongoDB for data storage
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- JWT for authentication
- Jest for testing

### Browser Extension
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- TypeScript for type safety
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Secure storage for sensitive data

## Data Flow

1. **Threat Detection Flow**
   ```
   Browser Extension -> Backend API -> Threat Analysis -> Dashboard Update
   ```

2. **Authentication Flow**
   ```
   User Login -> JWT Generation -> Secure API Access -> Session Management
   ```

3. **Real-time Updates**
   ```
   Threat Detection -> WebSocket -> Dashboard Update -> User Notification
   ```

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Secure password hashing
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input validation
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection
   - Secure headers

3. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - CORS configuration
   - API rate limiting
   - Request validation

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless architecture
   - Load balancing support
   - Database sharding
   - Caching layer

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Response caching
   - Database indexing
   - Query optimization
   - Asset optimization

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Production Environment**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes orchestration
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitoring and logging

2. **Development Environment**
   - Local development setup
   - Testing environment
   - Staging environment
   - Production mirror
